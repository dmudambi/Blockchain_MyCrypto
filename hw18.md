### Homework 18

#### Introduction 
In this homework, we set up our very own private blockchain and were asked to perform a transaction by sending some ETH from the node 1 account to node 2. The blockchain was greated using the tools presented in the Blockchain_Tools folder, starting with the ./puppeth function and using others such as ./geth and --datadir to create nodes and mining them.

#### Code and Configuration 
To create the two nodes, the input function looks something like the following:"./geth account new --datadir node1_hw" where a new account was created under the name node1_hw. Similarly the code can be slightly tweaked: "./geth account new --datadir node2_hw" to create the second node under the name node2_hw. 

Once the two nodes have been created, the first node can be set to mine using the function: "./geth --datadir node1_hw --mine --minerthreads 1". Using the enode of node1_hw, it was possible to link the second node, node2_hw, to node one using the code: "./geth --datadir node2_hw --port 30304 --rpc --bootnodes "enode://336d232269dd807619d31394d1fb6d0bcf34873c7a19e0c0442b3e9214e8af1e61e29cec565883bb1927a7d1aacc23aaf6751a1ecc4a8ccd1d9428a1da9df7a2@127.0.0.1:30303" —mine —minerthreads 1". This allows both nodes to undergo their mining process. 

Each node was given a blocktime of 15 and a code ID of 111 to link to MyCrypto. Unfortunately, the output given by the terminal command and the corresponding ETH balance on MyCrypto did not seem to sync. Due to this technical difficulty, I was unable to send any transaction from one node to another. Despite this, the process of sending the ETH itself is a very simple one which includes the account address of the second node, e.g. 0x5508F63BD552A6Fe9eb57AB9DA515f45db0C615A, and inputting a sample ETH amount to transact.  The same can be said about setting up the MyCrypto account for the private blockchain. It requires the chain ID which we entered in the genesis process, the network name and currency (ETH). Using standard URL: "http://127.0.0.1:8545", we could connect our genesis blockchain to our MyCrypto wallet.
